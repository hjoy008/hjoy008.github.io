My name is Jiahui Han, but you can call me Joy! (she/her)

![Heyaaa](/assets/img/me.jpg)

I'm a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan with a minor in English. I'm super passionate about technology and problem-solving! I am a solid programmer with knowledge of data structures and algorithms, my strongest language being C++, and I love studying tech-related fields in my free time, anything from cybersecurity to game development. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing cello, reading novels, or staring at birds. I'm always down to chat, so feel free to reach out! :)
