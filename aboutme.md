My name is Jiahui Han, but you can call me Joy! (she/her)

I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan with a double major in English. I'm super passionate about technology and problem-solving! I'm a web developer by day and a cybersecurity nerd by night. My strongest language is C++, but I can Google syntax in *any* language. :)

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing cello, reading novels, or staring at birds. I'm always down to chat, so feel free to reach out!
