I'm excited to start working as a software developer for the [Radiological Health Engineering (RHE) Laboratory](https://rhelab.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. I joined the lab through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, and I'll be working under Dr. Jordan Noey. This project is a software package that fits mathematical models to the glow curves generated by thermoluminescent dosimeters. It's written mostly in C++ and will hopefully be available for other researchers to use soon.
