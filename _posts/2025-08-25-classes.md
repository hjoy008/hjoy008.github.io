## Currently Taking
EECS 370: Computer Organization  

This class focuses on the intersection between hardware and software. We've studied the basics of computer architecture using some popular ISAs like ARM, and we've practiced writing code in C and assembly. I really enjoy the intricacies of low-level hardware design, though I definitely miss the comfortable abstractions of software that I'm used to. Our projects include an assembler to generate machine code and a linker to create object files. 


EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science  

This is a proof-based computer science theory class. We're given methods to rigorously prove the correctness of algorithms, from greedy to dynamic programming. In addition, we're learning about undecidable problems with Turing machines, Turing reductions and more proofs. I think we may as well call it the Turing class at this point.
