It's difficult to describe the experience of meeting Kiwi for the first time. Kiwi, after all, cannot introduce itself---it's a complicated piece of machinery on wheels, with cables running down the length of its frame and various electronics fastened to its body. But when Kiwi rolled its way over to me and handed me a slip of paper using its robotic arm, I was enchanted before I even read the contents of the paper. (Of course, it was an advertisement for the project team. What a shill you are, Kiwi.)

This year, I'm working on building Kiwi's successor: a rover that will compete in the [University Rover Challenge](https://mrover.org/about/). The event, held annually in Utah, consists of challenges that range from finding water bottles in the desert to collecting soil samples and analyzing potential signs of life. I'm part of the Teleoperation subteam in the Software division, and we're responsible for the graphical user interface (GUI) that operators will use to control and monitor the rover. 

For this role, I'm learning the basics of web development using Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like Vue.js. I'm in charge of specific components, like the real-time notification center, as well as general improvements to the GUI for competition. In addition, I am working with the Windows and Linux operating systems instead of my preferred MacOS. I really enjoy the giant balancing act that is full-stack integration, and it's thrilling to see my efforts manifested in a real, rolling rover. I watched in awe as an operator drove our new prototype forward and immediately crashed into a snowbank. That's engineering for ya.
