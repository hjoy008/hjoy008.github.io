Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of: 

- **Shadowscript:** a text-based fantasy RPG coded in C++ as a personal project in Summer 2025. It's a "choose-your-own-adventure" style game with an object-oriented inventory system and an RNG-based battle simulator. Being the fantasy nerd that I am, I also scripted the narration and dialogue.
- **Beat Rush:** an AI-powered rhythm game for HackMIT 2025. Music is generated by the Suno.ai API, then a video game stage is automatically generated on our web app. The frontend was implemented with React and Next.js, while the graphics used Tailwind CSS. We also connected a custom 3D-printed controller using the BBC micro:bit as a base.
