Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of: 

- **Shadowscript:** a text-based fantasy RPG coded in C++ as a personal project in Summer 2025.

You wake up in a dark, dark forest...

You're lying flat on your back, surrounded by shadowy boughs that seem laden with secrets.
Between the gaps in the trees, you can see glimpses of the night sky unspooling above you.
It's a strange but beautiful sight.
